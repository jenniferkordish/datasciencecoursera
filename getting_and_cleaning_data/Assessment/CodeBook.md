# The CodeBook

No other transformations than the ones done in the script have been performed on the data. The script merges many the different files,
into one single dataset as it has been stated in the exercise *(see readme for the exercise's description)*.

The input is described in **README.txt** of the downloaded input.

The output represents the **average of each variable for each activity and each subject**. In the table, each variable is represented by a column, and each activity or subject is represented by a row.
The columns names are slightly modified from the **features.txt** input file content: all parenthesis are removed. Row names are a merge of the subject and the activity. For instance, the row "1_LAYING" describes the means of the subject 1 for the LAYING activity.
